                    Agreement (“Agreement”) on behalf of yourself and the entity that you represent (all such parties, collectively,
                    “You” or “Counterparty”). If You do not agree to this Agreement, or if you do not have authority to bind
                    the entity that you represent to this Agreement, then you may not use the Programs. NextEra Energy Resources,

                    WHEREAS, Company is developing one or more website applications, mobile applications, software applications and/or other
                    technology that may be useful to Counterparty in connection with the presentation of certain plant data
                    (“Programs”); WHEREAS, Counterparty wishes to evaluate the Programs and provide feedback with respect
                    to the functionality of the Programs; WHEREAS, the Parties desire to hold discussions and exchange information
                    regarding the Programs (“Proposed Transaction”); WHEREAS, in the course of evaluating the Proposed Transaction
                    it will be necessary for one Party (“Disclosing Party”) to release certain Confidential Information (as
                    defined below) to the other Party (“Receiving Party”)
                </p>
                <p>

                    <p> 1. Scope. This site may allow You to access one or more website applications, mobile applications, software
                        applications and/or other technology for Your Use in connection with the presentation of certain
                        plant data (“Programs”). This is provided on a beta testing basis only, without warranty of functionality.
                        As part of the beta testing, You agree to evaluate the Programs and provide feedback with respect
                        to the functionality of the Programs. You also agree to treat all Programs as Confidential Information
                        of Company, as further provided in this Agreement. </p>
                    <p>2. Beta Test. a. Company shall provide Counterparty with electronic access to the Programs. Counterparty
                        will provide Company with feedback with respect to the form and functionality of the Programs (“Feedback”).
                        As between the parties, Company shall be the sole owner of the Feedback. b. The Programs are proprietary
                        to, and a valuable trade secret of, Company. They are entrusted to Counterparty only for the purposes
                        set forth in this Agreement. Counterparty shall not, without Company's prior written consent: i.
                        disclose any information about the Programs, their design and performance specifications, their code,
                        and/or the existence of the beta test and its results to anyone other than Counterparty’s employees
                        who are performing the testing and who shall be subject to nondisclosure restrictions at least as
                        protective as those set forth in this Agreement; ii. copy any portion of the Programs or related
                        documentation, except to the extent necessary to perform beta testing; or iii. reverse engineer,
                        decompile or disassemble the Programs or any portion thereof. c. Counterparty is solely responsible
                        for the security of Counterparty’s devices upon which the Programs are installed and/or viewed. Counterparty
                        shall take reasonable security precautions to prevent the Programs from being seen by unauthorized
                        individuals. d. The Programs are for testing purposes only and their accuracy and reliability are
                        not guaranteed. Counterparty shall not rely on the Programs for any purpose whatsoever. Counterparty
                        waives any and all claims that may arise against Company in connection with the use of the Programs
                        and/or from the performance or nonperformance of the Programs. COMPANY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL REPRESENTATIONS
                        OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE PROGRAMS, INCLUDING ANY
                        IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

                    <p>
                        3. Confidentiality. a. Confidential Information. As part of the beta test, the Parties may hold discussions and exchange
                        information regarding the development and functionalities of the Programs (collectively, the “Proposed
                        Transaction”). In the course of evaluating the Proposed Transaction it will be necessary for one
                        Party (“Disclosing Party”) to release certain Confidential Information (as defined below) to the
                        other Party (“Receiving Party”). “Confidential Information” shall mean all information, regardless
                        of the form in which it is communicated or maintained (whether oral, written, electronic or visual)
                        and whether prepared by Disclosing Party or otherwise, which is disclosed to Receiving Party, regardless
                        of whether such information is disclosed before or after the execution of this Agreement, in connection
                        with the Proposed Transaction and including all records, reports, analyses, notes, memoranda, documentation,
                        data, specifications, diagrams, statistics, systems or software, manuals, business plans, operational
                        information or practices, processes (whether or not patented, patentable or reduced to practice),
                        customer lists, contractual arrangements with, and information about, the Disclosing Party’s suppliers,
                        distributors and customers, the existence of the discussions between the Parties concerning the Proposed
                        Transaction, or other information that are based on, contain or reflect any such Confidential Information.
                        For the avoidance of doubt, Company’s Confidential Information specifically includes the Programs
                        and any and all data disclosed by or through Company, NextEra Energy, Inc., its affiliates, or their
                        respective owners, officers, employees, members, or representatives. b. Confidential Information
                        shall not include: (a) information which is or becomes publicly available other than as a result
                        of a violation of this Agreement; (b) information which is or becomes available on a non-confidential
                        basis from a source which is not known to the Receiving Party to be prohibited from disclosing such
                        information pursuant to a legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation to the Disclosing Party; (c)
                        information which the Receiving Party can demonstrate was legally in its possession prior to disclosure
                        by the Disclosing Party; or (d) information which is developed by or for Receiving Party independently
                        of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information. c. Nondisclosure and Use of Confidential Information.
                        Confidential Information shall not be used for any purpose other than to analyze, evaluate, negotiate,
                        implement or complete the Proposed Transaction. Confidential Information shall be held in strict
                        confidence by Receiving Party and shall not be disclosed without prior written consent of Disclosing
                        Party, except to those advisors, affiliates, agents, assigns, attorneys, employees, directors, officers
                        and/or members (“Agents”) with a need-to-know the Confidential Information for the purposes of analyzing,
                        implementing or completing the Proposed Transaction. Receiving Party shall be responsible for any
                        breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party or its Agents. The Receiving Party shall use the
                        same degree of care to protect the Confidential Information as the Receiving Party employs to protect
                        its own information of like importance, but in no event less than a reasonable degree of care based
                        on industry standard. d. Required Disclosure. In the event that Receiving Party is requested or required
                        by legal or regulatory authority to disclose any Confidential Information, the Receiving Party shall
                        promptly notify the Disclosing Party of such request or requirement prior to disclosure, if permitted
                        by law, so that Disclosing Party may seek an appropriate protective order. In the event that a protective
                        order or other remedy is not obtained, Receiving Party agrees to furnish only that portion of the
                        Confidential Information that it reasonably determines, in consultation with its counsel, is consistent
                        with the scope of the subpoena or demand, and to exercise reasonable efforts to obtain assurance
                        that confidential treatment will be accorded such Confidential Information. Receiving Party will
                        provide reasonable cooperation to Disclosing Party and its legal counsel with respect to performance
                        of the covenants undertaken pursuant to this Section 3. e. Remedies. The Receiving Party agrees that
                        money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement and that Disclosing
                        Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive or other equitable relief to remedy or prevent any breach
                        or threatened breach of this Agreement. Such remedy shall not be the exclusive remedy for any breach
                        of this Agreement, but shall be in addition to all other rights and remedies available at law or
                        in equity. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, the Receiving Party’s liability
                        to the Disclosing Party in connection with this Agreement and any activities undertaken in connection
                        with the evaluation of the Proposed Transaction shall be limited to direct damages and shall exclude
                        any other liability, including without limitation liability for special, indirect, punitive or consequential
                        damages in contract, tort, warranty, strict liability or otherwise. f. Return or Destruction. At
                        any time upon the Disclosing Party’s written request, the Receiving Party shall return or destroy,
                        at the Receiving Party’s option, all written Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, including
                        that portion of such Confidential Information that may be found in analyses, compilations, studies
                        or other documents prepared by, or for, the Receiving Party, and the Receiving Party and its Agents
                        shall not retain any copies of such written Confidential Information; provided, however, that Confidential
                        Information may be retained by the Receiving Party to the extent that retention of such Confidential
                        Information is necessary to comply with the Receiving Party’s internal document retention policies
                        aimed at legal, corporate governance or regulatory compliance and any such retained Confidential
                        Information shall remain subject to the disclosure and use restrictions set forth herein, notwithstanding
                        any termination of this Agreement. The Receiving Party shall, upon written request of the Disclosing
                        Party, cause one of its duly authorized officers to certify in writing to the Disclosing Party that
                        the requirements of the preceding sentence have been satisfied in full. The Receiving Party shall
                        not be deemed to have retained or failed to return or destroy any Confidential Information if Confidential
                        Information received or stored in digital format is deleted from local hard drives so long as no
                        attempt is made to recover such Confidential Information from servers or back-up sources, provided
                        that any such retained Confidential Information shall remain subject to the disclosure and use restrictions
                        set forth herein, notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement. g. No License. It is understood
                        that nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as granting or conferring rights by license
                        or otherwise in any Confidential Information disclosed to Receiving Party. Nothing in this Agreement
                        is intended to prevent either Party hereto from using its own Confidential Information which it furnished
                        hereunder for dealings with third parties for any purpose. h. Each Party acknowledges that the Disclosing
                        Party provides the Confidential Information on an “as is” basis and without warranty of any kind.
                        THE DISCLOSING PARTY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES PERTAINING TO THE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION,
                        WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY
                        AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
                    </p>
                    <p>4. No Other Agreement. It is understood that this Agreement is not intended to and does not, obligate
                        either Party to enter into any further agreements or to proceed with any possible relationship or
                        other transaction, including without limitation the Proposed Transaction, or to require either Party
                        to disclose any information under this Agreement. Any pricing lists, proposals or summaries disclosed
                        under this Agreement are intended only to provide a framework for further discussions between the
                        Parties. Pricing documents are not an offer or a commitment of Company or Counterparty. </p>
                    <p>5. Amendment. Any amendment to this Agreement must be in writing and signed by an authorized representative
                        of each Party.
                    </p>
                    <p>6. No Assignment. This Agreement may not be assigned by either Party unless prior written consent is
                        obtained; however, upon written notice to Counterparty, Company may assign this Agreement (including
                        the right to enforce its terms) to a parent, affiliate or subsidiary at its sole discretion without
                        consent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        7. Non-Waiver. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to be nor shall constitute a waiver of any other
                        provision whether or not similar, nor shall any waiver constitute a continuing waiver. No waiver
                        shall be binding unless executed in writing by the Party making the waiver.
                    </p>

                        8. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida
                        without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. Any disputes resulting in litigation between the
                        Parties shall be conducted in the state or federal courts of the State of Florida.
                    </p>

                        whichever occurs first. However, the obligations contained herein shall remain in effect for a period
                        of one (1) year from the date the Confidential Information was disclosed under this Agreement.
                    </p>

                        10. Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the full and entire agreement between the Parties regarding the confidentiality
                        of Confidential Information.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        of which may be deemed an original, and all of which together constitute one and the same agreement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        12. Authorization and Binding Obligations. Each Party represents to the other Party that the execution, delivery and performance

                        13. Waiver of Trial by Jury. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND
                        INTENTIONALLY WAIVES THE RIGHT EITHER OF THEM MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
